Project: Predictive Modeling for Water Quality Monitoring

Overview:
This project addresses the critical need to monitor and predict water quality to mitigate the risks posed by pollution and climate change. By leveraging data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to anticipate water quality issues before they become hazardous.

Key Steps and Methodology:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed summary statistics and identified correlations between key variables in the dataset to uncover patterns and trends.

Algorithm Selection:
Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and LightGBM.
Evaluated algorithms using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained the models on a structured dataset and rigorously evaluated their performance.
LightGBM emerged as the top-performing model with the highest recall and an F1-score of 0.87, outperforming other models.

Model Deployment:
Deployed the LightGBM model for predicting water quality on new datasets.
Designed monitoring strategies to assess and maintain model performance over time.

Tools & Techniques:
Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Machine Learning Metrics: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.
