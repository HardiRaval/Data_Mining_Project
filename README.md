* Prepared the dataset for model training, including feature engineering, data scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.
* Trained each of the selected algorithms on the structured training dataset.
* Rigorously evaluated the performance of the trained models using relevant machine learning metrics:
    * **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the predictions.
    * **Precision:** Ability of the model to avoid false positives.
    * **Recall:** Ability of the model to identify all positive instances.
    * **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of performance.
    * **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of the model's prediction outcomes (true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives).

**4. Model Selection and Results**

* Based on the evaluation metrics, **LightGBM** emerged as the top-performing model.
* LightGBM demonstrated the **highest recall**, indicating its strong ability to identify potential water quality issues.
* The model achieved an impressive **F1-score of 0.87**, signifying a well-balanced performance in terms of precision and recall, outperforming other tested algorithms.

**5. Model Deployment**

* Deployed the trained LightGBM model to enable prediction of water quality on new, unseen datasets.
* Considered strategies for integrating the model into existing water quality monitoring systems or developing new interfaces for prediction.

**6. Monitoring and Maintenance**
